research_agent:

Create a research agent that uses Google Search with an iterative refinement pattern. The agent should:
1. Accept research topics from users
2. Use a Loop agent pattern to iteratively improve search queries and gather information
3. Have specialized sub-agents:
   - One for analyzing and refining search queries (use gemini-2.5-pro for better reasoning)
   - One for executing searches and extracting insights (use gemini-2.5-flash for speed)
4. Include proper loop termination with exit_loop tool
5. Use Google Search as the primary tool
6. Limit to 3 iterations maximum
The architecture should follow ADK best practices with proper agent hierarchy and tool assignments.
